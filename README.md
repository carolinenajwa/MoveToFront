# MoveToFront
This program implements a singly linked list data structure which will hold integer elements, to execute a move-to-front (MFT) strategy when being searched. During the searching process, a data member will store the count of the number of nodes traversed in inside list before arriving at its desired location(node). The elements in the list will be searched in two different ways, in a uniform distribution and a normal distribution. The program will then output the result of average number of nodes traversed for each distribution.
